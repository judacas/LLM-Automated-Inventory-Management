# Architecture and scope (always apply)

- Align user-side flow to `projectOverview.md` and `Flowchart.png`.
- Only implement the **user-side** path: email intake -> onboarding -> user orchestrator -> quote/purchase/inventory.
- Admin flow is intentionally excluded for now (no admin endpoints or agents).
- Keep it simple: no DB, no real email provider, no auth/OAuth; stub where needed.
- Use Azure services as the target platform (Azure OpenAI, Azure App Service).
- Favor modular, readable structure over clever abstractions.
