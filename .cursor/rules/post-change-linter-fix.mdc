# After code changes: run linter fixer

When you have finished making code changes (edits, new files, or refactors), **invoke the linter-fixer subagent** so it can:

- Run linting and see all LSP/linter errors (via the run-linting skill)
- Fix mechanical issues (style, simple syntax, obvious imports/types)
- Delegate to you any issues that need design or broader context
- Report back with a concise summary of fixes and delegated items (no trial-and-error bloat)

Do not skip this step. Let the subagent run, then handle any delegated issues it returns.
