# Python code guidelines

- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Prefer explicit names over abbreviations; avoid cleverness.
- Use type hints for public functions and key data structures.
- Keep orchestration logic in `agents/`, shared state in `state.py`, and IO stubs in `channels/`.
- No auth/security scaffolding unless explicitly requested.
