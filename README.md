[![CI](https://github.com/judacas/LLM-Automated-Inventory-Management/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/judacas/LLM-Automated-Inventory-Management/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a group final project for 5 final semester computer engineers at USF working with Microsoft.

The project builds an AI-driven, multi-agent customer service system for Contoso that automates quote requests, purchase orders, and inventory management using LLMs, A2A communication, and MCP. It includes email-based customer workflows with onboarding and authorization rules, quote persistence, inventory updates, and an admin conversational interface to monitor outstanding quotes, unavailable items, and system status, all within Azure and compliance/budget constraints.
